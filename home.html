    <hr>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to legend, Dayu harnessed the water and used his axe to split the mountain into three gorges: "Human Gate", "Shen Gate", and "Ghost Gate", which led the water of the Yellow River to the east. The jurisdiction is located in the foothills of the Qinling Yumai Mountain, and stands in the territory of the ancient valley of the Hangu Pass. Sanmenxia is also known as "Xiahan" because it was called "Xiahan" in the ancient times.
